# **308.** Tribals

**308.1.** Each tribal card has another card type. Casting and resolving a tribal card follows the rules for casting and resolving a card of the other card type.

**308.2.** Tribal subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Tribal Enchantment — Merfolk.” The set of tribal subtypes is the same as the set of creature subtypes; these subtypes are called creature types. Tribals may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3m for the complete list of creature types.
