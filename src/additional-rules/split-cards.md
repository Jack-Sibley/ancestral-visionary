# **709.** Split Cards

**709.1.** Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal Magic card back.

**709.2.** Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.

**709.3.** A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.
+ **709.3a** Only the chosen half is evaluated to see if it can be cast. Only that half is considered to be put onto the stack.
+ **709.3b** While on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being cast exist. The other half’s characteristics are treated as though they didn’t exist.
+ **709.3c** An effect may create a copy of a split card and allow a player to cast the copy. That copy retains the characteristics of the two halves separated into the same two halves as the original card. (See rule 707.12.)

**709.4.** In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves combined. This is a change from previous rules.
+ **709.4a** Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a split card’s name, the player must choose one of those names and not both. An object has the chosen name if one of its names is the chosen name.
+ **709.4b** The mana cost of a split card is the combined mana costs of its two halves. A split card’s colors and mana value are determined from its combined mana cost. An effect that refers specifically to the symbols in a split card’s mana cost sees the separate symbols rather than the whole mana cost.

      Example: Assault//Battery’s mana cost is {3}{R}{G}. It’s a red and green card with a mana value of 5. If you cast Assault, the resulting spell is a red spell with a mana value of 1.

      Example: Fire//Ice’s mana cost is {2}{U}{R}. It has the same mana cost as Steam Augury, but an effect such as that of Jegantha, the Wellspring sees that it contains the mana symbol {1} twice.
+ **709.4c** A split card has each card type specified on either of its halves and each ability in the text box of each half.
+ **709.4d** The characteristics of a fused split spell on the stack are also those of its two halves combined (see rule 702.102, “Fuse”).
