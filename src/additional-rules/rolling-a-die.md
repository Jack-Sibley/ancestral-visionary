# **706.** Rolling a Die

**706.1.** An effect that instructs a player to roll a die will specify what kind of die to roll and how many of those dice to roll.
+ **706.1a** Such an effect may refer to an “N-sided die,” “N-sided dice,” or one or more “dN,” where N is a positive integer. In all cases, the die must have N equally-likely outcomes, numbered from 1 to N. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.
+ **706.1b** Players may agree to use an alternate method for rolling a die, including a digital substitute, as long as the method used has the same number of equally-likely outcomes as the die specified in the instruction.

**706.2.** After the roll, the number indicated on the top face of the die before any modifiers is the natural result. The instruction may include modifiers to the roll which add to or subtract from the natural result. Modifiers may also come from other sources. After considering all applicable modifiers, the final number is the result of the die roll.

**706.3.** Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice include a results table.
+ **706.3a** The results table appears as a chart with multiple striations. Each striation includes possible results and an effect associated with those results. The possible results indicated could be a single number, a range of numbers with two endpoints in the form “N1–N2,” or a range with a single endpoint in the form “N+.” Each striation of the results chart means “If the result was in this range, [effect].” After a die roll, use the result to determine which effect listed on the results table happens.
+ **706.3b** An instruction to roll one or more dice, any instructions to modify that roll printed in the same paragraph, any additional instructions based on the result of the roll, and the associated results table are all part of one ability.
+ **706.3c** Some effects in results charts include the text “Roll again.” This additional roll uses the same kind of and number of dice originally called for, including any applicable modifiers.

**706.4.** Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice do not include a results table. The text of those abilities will indicate how to use the results of the die rolls.

**706.5.** If a player is instructed to roll two or more dice and ignore the lowest roll, the roll that yielded the lowest result is considered to have never happened. No abilities trigger because of the ignored roll, and no effects apply to that roll. If multiple results are tied for the lowest, the player chooses one of those rolls to be ignored.

**706.6.** In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
