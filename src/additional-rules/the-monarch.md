# **721.** The Monarch

**721.1.** The monarch is a designation a player can have. There is no monarch in a game until an effect instructs a player to become the monarch.

**721.2.** There are two inherent triggered abilities associated with being the monarch. These triggered abilities have no source and are controlled by the player who was the monarch at the time the abilities triggered. This is an exception to rule 113.8. The full texts of these abilities are “At the beginning of the monarch’s end step, that player draws a card” and “Whenever a creature deals combat damage to the monarch, its controller becomes the monarch.”

**721.3.** Only one player can be the monarch at a time. As a player becomes the monarch, the current monarch ceases to be the monarch.

**721.4.** If the monarch leaves the game, the active player becomes the monarch at the same time as that player leaves the game. If the active player is leaving the game or if there is no active player, the next player in turn order becomes the monarch. If no player still in the game can become the monarch, the game continues with no monarch.
